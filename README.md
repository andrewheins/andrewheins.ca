 The goal of this theme is to standardize our initial installation of WordPress to reduce the initial setup work required for each site.

Usage Instructions
=====

1. Clone this repo at your site root.

2. Do a global find/replace for `your_theme_slug` with whatever you want the theme slug to be within the repo

3. Rename the theme folder whatever you called the theme slug

4. run `npm install` at site root

5. start `grunt`

6. Create a database for the site to use
